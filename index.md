### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, while very simplistic and easy it definitely was my favorite. It was the start of my coding career. Here I was able to explore all the essentials for the first time like cloning a repository on my terminal and printing out my first message.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was another lab I had a fun time doing. The goal for this lab was to create a sandwich by filling in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. What I learned from this lab was testing my program since I had to make sure the program passed all the test cases.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs since it consisted of making a pattern with loops. The goal was to use dashes, asterisks, and bars to create the illusion of the pattern. This was accomplished by learning how to print cout messages.
